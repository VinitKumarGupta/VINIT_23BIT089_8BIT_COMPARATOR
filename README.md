## Overview

This project showcases the complete RTL-to-GDSII implementation of a sequential 8-bit magnitude comparator using the Synopsys ASIC toolchain and SAED 32nm standard cell library. It was developed as part of a 5-day hands-on VLSI workshop, culminating in the successful generation of a synthesized netlist, physical layout, and post-layout timing closure using industry-grade tools.

### About 8-bit Magnitude Comparator

An 8-bit magnitude comparator is a digital logic circuit that compares two 8-bit binary inputs (A and B) and determines their relationship:

* `A > B` â†’ Output a\_gt\_b = 1
* `A < B` â†’ Output a\_lt\_b = 1
* `A == B` â†’ Output a\_eq\_b = 1

The design is synchronous, clock-driven, and modeled in Verilog HDL.

## Project Highlights

- Fully functional sequential RTL design of an 8-bit comparator
- Behavioral simulation using VCS + waveform debugging via Verdi
- Logic synthesis using Design Compiler with SAED32nm standard cells
- Custom SDC constraints and gate-level optimization (compile\_ultra)
- Physical design using IC Compiler II: floorplanning â†’ routing
- Post-layout STA with PrimeTime; timing met with slack = 0.58 ns
